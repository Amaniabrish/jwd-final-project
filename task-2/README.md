## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create the page structure

In this step, we'll create a basic HTML structure and include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

1. Create a new file called `about.html` iside your project folder
2. Create a new Github repo and add, commit and push your `about.html` page.

### Step 2: Implementing your About page

Go through the different [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/alerts/) and select the ones that are more similar 
to your wireframes created on Task 1.
