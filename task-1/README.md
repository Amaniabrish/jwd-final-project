# Task 1: Design your App Wireframes

## Description

Is always a good practice to design first before start coding. The objective of this task is to create the Task planner app wireframes to understand how it will work and look.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1:

### Step 2: The TaskManager Class

In this step, we'll create a `TaskManager` class that
will be responsible for managing the tasks in the application.

> #### Useful Resources for this step
> - [ECMAScript 2015 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance#ECMAScript_2015_Classes)

1. Create a `TaskManager` class in `js/taskManager.js`
2. Within the `constructor` of the `TaskManager` class, initialize a `this.tasks` property on the class equal to an empty array.

> #### Test Your Code!
> Now is a good chance to test your code, head over to `js/index.js` and do the following
>
> 1. Initialize a new instance of `TaskManager`
> 2. `console.log()` the `tasks` property
>
> **Expected Result**
> You should see an empty array logged to the browser.

### Step 3: Adding A New Task Programmatically



## Results

You should have implemented the different screens of your application, meeting the following acceptance criteria:

* Contains a Task Form with the required information (Name, Description, AssignedTo, DueDate, Status)
* Contains a Task Layout (check this Card Layout example) with the required information (Name, Description, AssignedTo, DueDate, Status)
* Wireframe solves all the UI challenges to represent the Task Planner and a clear view of a Task with the required fields(Name, Description, AssignedTo, DueDate, Stat
